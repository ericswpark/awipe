        awipe will help you wipe a device by writing random data to a file in the internal storage,
        overwriting free space on the device. For best results, ensure that your phone is encrypted
        before starting the wipe.\n\nOnce the operation is complete, restart the phone and wipe it
        clean from recovery.
